                <p><em><a href="http://www.typemoon.com/products/fate/index.html">Fate/stay night</a></em>, an 18+ visual novel released in January of 2004, is TYPE-MOON's first game as a commercial company. The game was extremely well-received, and became one of the best-selling galgame in 2004.</p>

                <p>Thanks to its success, the game has been adapted into anime, manga, films, and other media over the years. An all-age PS2 port titled <em><a href="http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/game/fatevita/">Fate/stay night [R&eacute;alta Nua]</a></em> featuring Japanese voice actors from the anime series was released in 2007 for PS2 and later PC and PS Vita.</p>

                <p>The story takes place in a Japanese town, Fuyuki City. Hidden from society, there has been a fierce war going on between seven sorcerers referred to as "Masters," who summon a powerful familiar called "Servants" and fight each other till the last one. The last one is said to attain the Holy Grail, which will grant them a wish. Only a few knows when this War begins and what the Holy Grail is, but now the war has chosen seven new Masters and is about to begin.</p>

                <p><em>Fate</em> tells the story of Emiya Shirou, who lost his parents in a fire many years ago and was adopted by a man who called himself a mage. Wanting to be just like his foster father, Shirou has been training to be a mage as well, however he find himself not very good at it and is barely able to use just on type of magecraft. His step father has since passed away, and now Shirou finds himself unwillingly involved in the Holy Grail War, and accidentally summons Saber, who is said to be the strongest Servant of all...</p>

                <p>As the story progresses, Shirou meets various friends and foes as they uncover the truth behind the Grail War. There are three routes in the game, each route centers around a different heroine, and tells an alternate version of the story, revealing different aspects of the Grail War and the characters involved.</p>
