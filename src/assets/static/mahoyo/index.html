                <p>A magical slice-of-life story of a countryside boy, two mysterious girls, and their intertwining lives.</p>

                <p>Aoko, an outgoing witch-in-training; Alice, a mysterious and cold magus who seems straight out of a fairy tale; Soujuurou, an average boy unaccustomed to the city life. Each with their own believes, values, and problems, meet and begin living under the same roof.</p>

                <p>Set in the nostalgic and uncertain backdrop of the 1980s, this is a tale about how three different personalities slowly mature and begin to accept each other, as each deal with day-to-day life, school, and the occasional magical battles.</p>

            <h2>&mdash;There once was a manor on the hill where two witches lived.</h2>

            <p><em><a href="http://www.typemoon.com/products/mahoyo/index.html">Mahoutsukai no Yoru</a></em> is a novel written by Nasu in his early 20s, and was adapted into a game 12 years later. The story and its world view has become the backbone of all other <a href="http://www.typemoon.com/">TYPE-MOON</a> works, including <em><a href="http://www.typemoon.org/kara/main.html">Kara no Kyoukai</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.typemoon.org/main.html">Tsukihime</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.typemoon.com/products/fate/index.html">Fate/stay night</a></em>, in other words, <em>Mahoutsukai no Yoru</em> is truly the origin of TYPE-MOON's fictional world&mdash;the beginning of TYPE-MOON.</p>

            <p>The story takes place in the late 1980s, an exciting time before the advent of cellphones and the Internet. A boy from rural countryside who had just arrived in the city meets two mysterious girls&mdash;the honest and unsophisticated Shizuki Soujuurou, the outgoing modern magus Aozaki Aoko, and the reserved witch Kuonji Alice who grew up isolated from the outside world&mdash;the fate of these three people is about to cross in the mansion on top of the hill. The story of <em>Mahoutsukai no Yoru</em> is not one about romance, but a slice-of-life tale of three people living together not out of feelings for each other, but out of convenience and necessity.</p>
