            <h1>Melty Blood</h1>

            <p>A 2D fighting game based on <em>Tsukihime</em>. Originally a collaboration between TYPE-MOON and French Bread (known as Watanabe Seisakujo before 2003), the game was originally released at the 2002 winter Comiket (C63) as a doujin fighter. An expansion patch called <em>Re-ACT</em> was released two years later in May 2004, and a patch called Final Tuned was later released for free in July 2005.</p>

            <p>While the game was developed by French Bread, TYPE-MOON was closely involved with its production, with character design and CG by Takeuchi, music by KATE, and most importantly, script by Nasu. Even though in name this is a <em>Tsukihime</em> doujin, in reality it had more or less become an official TYPE-MOON game. It also played a big role in promoting the popularity of <em>Tsukihime</em>.</p>

            <p>Thanks to its balanced gameplay, high production quality (60 FPS for a doujin game at the time), and fluid control, <em>Melty Blood</em> became a popular fighting game among fans and received many praise, and tournaments were held in various places in Japan. The <em>Re-ACT</em> patch further increased the game's success. In 2006, the popular international fighting game tournament Tougeki began featuring <em>Melty Blood</em> as one of its events.</p>

            <p>On March 2005, an arcade version of the game titled <em>Melty Blood Act Cadenza</em> was released by Ecole Software, which was ported to PlayStation 2 in 2006. An update of <em>Act Cadenza</em>, entitled <em>Act Cadenza Ver.B</em>, was released in the arcades in December 2006 and later ported to the PC in 2007. The latest installment, <em>Melty Blood Actress Again</em>, was released by Ecole in September 2008 in Japan. <em>Melty Blood</em> has also been adapted into a manga series drawn by Kirishima Takeru and serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's <em>Comp Ace</em>.</p>
