It's not a very interesting story, but we went to middle school together. I was a very forgetful kid, and I forgot to bring an eraser to the new classroom I was going to be in.

I didn't really read that much. As I hung out more with Takeuchi, I found that we had similar tastes in manga, so I gradually got interested in reading. Then one day, he lent me 「Alien-Treasure Street」 by Hideyuki Kikuchi (*1). That sent me over the edge. And as I kept asking him to lend me more novels, I started to get interested in writing them myself.

It wasn't in any sort of circle, but in middle school we got together with our friends and played pen-and-paper RPGs (*3). I think that has to be the oldest example. I got a job in Hiroshima for a bit at one point, and one of my friends there was doing doujin work, so he invited me to start as well. Then I invited Nasu. We started by creating shounen-centric works for Comitia (*4), but after about a year we started TYPE-MOON up.

Until we started TYPE-MOON, we had been working together with them. They were really busy, though, and didn't want to work on making games. And once we started making 「Tsukihime」, we weren't able to do anything else. So we figured it was a good place for us to break off, and that brought us to where we are now.

I was writing one novel a year for magazines back then, but I would always go over the page limit, and then I would end up not being able to publish them at all. It's a pain to go back through and cut everything, and my general attitude was "I wrote it, and it's finished, so it's done." That's when Takeuchi came back from Hiroshima, saying he was going to start a homepage, and that he wanted me to do something for it. I said "Well, I could write a serial novel," sort of offhand, and that was the start of 「Kara no Kyoukai」. That was just before Takeuchi first went to Comitia. When we got into Comitia, he wanted me to bring my stuff there too, so I had to fiddle with getting it all together for that.

I was hoping people would come to our homepage to read Nasu's novel there. And of course, there were people who did... but a novel on the web is sort of hard to read. And we didn't really hear any especially good comments when we sold it at Comitia. Although, I told him before we began the serialization, "make sure it's something short and easy to read!"

Well, the reason it ended up like it did was because I knew I'd run out of stream if I had to keep writing short stories with totally different settings each week. I figured it'd be better for me to just cut up a big story into episode-sized chunks. And if each episode was self-contained, then it'd be easier to write, too. That's how I started out. Of course, once I got about three episodes in I really got attached to the story, and thought "this could be a turning point for me." That's when I really started putting a lot of effort into it, and it went out of control...(Laughs) And that's the jist of it.

Well...nothing, really. (Laughs) When we had to think up a name, we started throwing out really stupid names to one another, and just couldn't come up with a good one. At that time, the story (*6) I was working on had a hidden character in it called "Type Moon." We thought that was perfect, so we decided to make that our circle's name. It took five seconds. (Laughs) We thought that we were only going to use this circle to make 「Tsukihime」, so we didn't really worry that much about it. Everyone just kept thinking up such stupid names, there was no other way for us to decide. Names like "Funky Sun." (*7) I figured TYPE-MOON would be simple and easy to remember, and even a bit pretty.
