What elements did users particularly like about 「Tsukihime」?

<span id="takeuchi">Takeuchi</span></td><td>
Probably the story. We both made the game feeling that the story was very good, so we were glad to hear that. But I think being coupled with a good system helped it a lot. I think there's a miraculous level of balance in 「Tsukihime」. The sound guy was really busy during development, so there weren't many songs he wrote on the spot. Instead, he made arrangements of older songs he had written, and the atmosphere fit perfectly with 「Tsukihime」. We also used Nscripter, (*3) an amazing free tool. I think all of these elements helped users experience and enjoy the story so much.

Yes. We're collecting works from people who enjoyed 「Tsukihime」. We think this'll really make things a lot more interesting. It seems like a lot of creative people were moved by playing 「Tsukihime」. We received some comments from them. And guest art from very skilled artists. We also have to work hard ourselves to make sure they don't outshine us!

At first, we wanted to fill it with all sorts of different types of contents. We received a lot of suggestions, after all. About Satsuki's scenario, etc. We wanted to address as many as we could. And when we thought about focusing on certain things in 「Kagetsu Tohya」, we came up with certain unnecessary elements. And also things we wouldn't be able to do due to time constraints. In the end, we had to cut certain things out. But in the long run, it turned out to be more well-rounded as a result, I think.

In the scope of 「Tsukihime」's timeline, it is in a complicated spot. We thought about splitting it at first. Serious 「Tsukihime」 stories here, and ridiculous stuff over there. But that made things even more confusing, so we just put it all together. I think it's fun overall, though.

I had 10 in my mind in the beginning. But then I ended up designing even more, sort of playing around, putting characters like Type Mercury (*6) in. It's because we have all this backstory that it's fun to talk about what we could do. In our talks about 「Tsukihime 2」, though, we've gotten to a point where things are sort of decided. Or on the other hand, we realize "Wait, this isn't 「Tsukihime」 anymore." (Laughs)
