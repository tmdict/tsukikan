Akari from 「Hikaru no Go」. (*5) I really like her. When we changed the story from 30 days to 10, I wanted to make an exciting spot in the center. Nero's stuff all got finished really quickly, but we were still figuring out what to do with Akiha. We wanted a character like Nero. We thought of a sort of gay Kaoru character (*6) at first, a sort of dyed-in-the-wool serial killer (Laughs), so we decided to emphasize Shiki's serial-killer like qualities. In the Akiha route, the player isn't sure whether or not Shiki is a serial killer, so we wanted something to parallel that. That was our initial plan, but then Nasu said "If I have a choice, I'd like it to be a girl." That fit with what I was doing graphically at the time, so I decided to draw her like Akari.

Any True Ancestor aside from the very first one is artificial in some way or another. Arcueid is an Ancestor who was created even though there was really no need for her.

Yes. I was actually told this before and felt it to be a bit abnormal myself. I'm sorry to say this, but there's actually no big reason for that. Basically, the church in the 「Tsukihime」 world only likes humans. Things that aren't human at all can be controlled so they don't need to be made into enemies. So completely different races are fine. But things that were born from humans, in other words, things that may carry the possibility of "infection" to other humans are treated like diseases that need to be cut off. That's about all the reasoning I can give.

Their way of thinking began to get twisted when the Burial Agency was created. They were made for that very purpose, so unless they think that way, they have no other reason to exist.

Vampires in the first half, and then Shiki appears in the second half...people have already played through that pattern. And the Kohaku route was designed basically with the assumption that players already kind of know how the story goes. So we had Shiki leave early on purpose.<br />
There was one more thing we wanted to do -- put in dialog between the vampires. So we just went ahead and made it. At this point, Shiki's drugged and lost his reason. So they sort of talk to each other with no real idea of what's going on...he's kind of on a high, even though all the dangerous things about him are visible.
