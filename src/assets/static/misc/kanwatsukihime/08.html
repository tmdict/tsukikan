I'm convinced someone erased the characters for my name and replaced them with the 'eggplant' ones when I was asleep or something. (Laughs) Every time I type my name I know I type it right. But I can't do blind typing, so I always have to look at my fingers when I type. I guess that's when the little gremlins do their work. (Laughs)<br />
But once I learn something, I know, it's hard for me to change. If I remember someone's name wrong once, then I call them that name over and over again. (*1) To be honest, I remember all that I've written, but for some reason in proofreading, I have it remembered as the proper sentence I meant to write, so I don't notice the typos. I guess that's how the funny names got out... over and over again. (Laughs)

Yeah, I know what you mean. It's really hard to read it from an outside perspective. When we read our eyes automatically correct most things. I think it's easier to notice on a larger screen, though. If you check on a smaller screen, you always miss something.

I can't look at B46 with a straight face. He did such detailed, precise checking, it's thanks to him that the finished product looks more complete. I don't want to say we had a problem with the other proofreader, WOrd, but he didn't do the kind of proofreading we were looking for, and let a lot slip by... so don't bully me too much about the typos.

In an interview with 「BugBug」, Takeuchi said "Nasu Kinoko has really hard spots, and really soft spots, he's rather extreme in both." I think so too, but I'm also a big poser.
