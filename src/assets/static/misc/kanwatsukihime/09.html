I was asked by another circle I had been working with if I'd like to put out a book with them. I had an idea dealing with Valkyries floating in my hand for a while, so I wanted to try that. Why did I pick Valkyries? It felt like a good material to use. Whenever I think about ideas, I always think of them in relation to how catchy they are. Like with 「Tsukihime」, there's no other big catch than the main character killing the heroine in the beginning, so I wanted to really push that.

I like starting from that point. 「Mahoutsukai no Yoru」 was the same way as 「Valkyrie」. The story begins from the point where the character comes to kill another. How do the two come together? That's the type of situation we like our readers to enjoy.<br />
I don't really have clear themes when I create stories. Nasu really does, though. Like we just spoke of. (*2) I just have a strong sense of wanting to make my readers have a really good time. But in order for that to happen, first we have to have fun. Then they can join us. "Entertainment" may be my theme for everything.
