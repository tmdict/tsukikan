Takeuchi's friends and guests would visit the BBS. It was pretty normal, I think.

That year at the winter Comiket. I went all the way out there from Oita. (Laughs)

My first impression of Takeuchi was that he was cool and passionate. Nasu was like Kokutou from 「Kara no Kyoukai」.

It just happened all of a sudden...

We had lunch together on the first day, then by the evening we were planning out where to go and what to buy. (Laughs)

So they weren't involved in a circle that year?

No. Earlier, Takeuchi did something with 「Valkyria」 at Comitia... I think.

The "Human Rocket Launcher" is just what it sounds like... it can only destroy... ahhhh!

Or rather, since Aoko find it to be entertaining, so she never thinks about what happens afterwards. (Laughs)

I imagine it's hard for people who have only read 「Tsukihime」 to imagine.

Yes. (Laughs) It's something very different, but not a total 180-degree turn.

Other than that, he would just go on and on about stuff he knew we couldn't do. (Laughs) Like "after the shower, Akiha goes back for more!"
