We have 5 members right now. I, Takeuchi Takashi, am the graphic and art supervisor. I'm also the circle representative. Nasu Kinoko is the script writer and game director. Next, we have Kiyobe. He's the programmer. KATE takes care of sound. And OKSG handles all the web work.

We had only gotten together to make 「Tsukihime」, so there was no real concept. We each just brought things in that we wanted to do, and tried to work together without silencing anyone.

We won't be going to Comitia as TYPE-MOON. We have been there as Bamboo Broom, though. I really hate going to places even though we have nothing to promote, so we won't be back until we have something.

Now...I feel like I still need to make that effort to some degree (Laughs) But the old me really felt like everything needed to be sharp. If it wasn't sharp, it couldn't cut through. And cutting through is the easiest way to leave an impression to influence people's hearts. But in the past few years, I've realized that you don't just have to cut. You can engulf people, hit them hard and shock them that way. There's no need to be needlessly pointed, I thought. (To Takeuchi) I don't do it anymore, do I?
