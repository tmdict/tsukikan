<p>This is an interview with Nasu and Urobuchi found in <em>ALL OVER/Zero</em>, a bonus booklet that came with the purchase of <em>Fate/Zero</em> volume 4 during <a href="http://www.typemoon.com/event/c73/index.htm">Comiket 73</a> (2007 December).</p>

<p>There are 20 questions total, while some of them answers some questions about the story and the settings, a majority are jokes and references to other works.</p>

<div class="main-content">
    <p><span class="question">Questions 1:</span> Saber and Irisviel seem to have established a great Master-Servant relationship, and it seems those two have not eaten together? [ Taitō &middot; Yurianna LUV-san ]</p>

        <td><img style="margin:7px 10px 7px 0;" src="../src/img/misc/fatezeroexchangeqa/nasu.jpg" alt="nasu" /></td>
        <td><span class="nasu">Nasu:</span> Because Irisviel is a homunculus, all she really needs is to have her magic re-supplied, and the same applies to Saber, who is a Servant. It's very fortunate that this pair does not have a high demand for food.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img style="margin:7px 10px 7px 0;" src="../src/img/misc/fatezeroexchangeqa/uro.jpg" alt="uro" /></td>
        <td><span class="uro">Uro:</span> Shirou's food education awoke Saber's gourmet spirit 10 years later, at the time of <em>Zero</em>, she probably thought all the food in the world was like fish and chips.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p><span class="question">Questions 2:</span> What's the limit of Berserker's ability to "turn any object into Noble Phantasm"? Will it work on a battleship? Why not just hijack a computer and become an existence like Sky*et... please put a stop to my overflowing dreams. [ Kyoto &middot; Musashibō-san ]</p>

        <td><span class="nasu">Nasu:</span> In theory it's limited to objects that are weapons. An aircraft carrier's role as weapon transportation is ranked higher than it being a weapon, so it shouldn't be counted as a weapon. Something like that. What's your opionion on this, Uro-san?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img style="margin:7px 10px 7px 0;" src="../src/img/misc/fatezeroexchangeqa/uro.jpg" alt="uro" /></td>
        <td><span class="uro">Uro:</span> For Berserker, the Noble Phantasm can only be activated for things he recognizes as "this is a weapon." In that case, if he is skilled in wrestling, can he... turn a steel chair into a Noble Phantasm?</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

        <td><span class="uro">Uro:</span> If it's a real competition, due to Iskander's complex shape, you'll need skirt with an overwhelming number of edges. This is the greatness of the King of Conquerors.</td>

    <p><span class="question">Questions 5:</span> Even though Kotomine parried Contender's bullet with his inner force, is his Ba Ji Quan really that strong? I'm very interested in this, please tell me. [ Taitō &middot; Bazett☆Tan ]</p>

        <td><span class="avenger">Avenger:</span> Ah, about that, Master, Urobuchi Ba Ji Quan is an internal style that surpasses external styles, he's also killer of Saibane Fist users, and one of these days he will complete some superhuman technique like the supersonic 6 Hit Fist, so you can't use it for reference. Also, why are you trying to weaponize yourself?</td>

    <tr>
        <td><img style="margin:7px 10px 7px 0;" src="../src/img/misc/fatezeroexchangeqa/uro.jpg" alt="uro" /></td>
        <td><span class="uro">Uro:</span> That's a technique that combines Ba Ji Quan and the miracle of magic. It's a feat that can only be accomplished by someone with a suicidal fighting style like Kotomine, who is willing to sacrifice one of his own arms.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p><span class="question">Questions 6:</span> In the end did Father Mite repent? Also, my Gin-Pika seems functionally different from the Gin-Pika here, can I return it? [ Taitō &middot; Fuyuki's Holy Virgin ]</p>

        <td><span class="uro">Uro:</span> According to Hollywood settings perhaps the Self-Defense Forces really is more advanced than the U.S. Air Force, using F-22 in the early 90s. The subtle detail of the night vision system on Kiritsugu's rifle also has its own antique flavor.</td>
    </tr>

        <td><span class="uro">Uro:</span> But at the same time Kinoko Dimension also took place in Fuyuki, so those who can survive will definitely live. Something this reasonable happens very rarely in Urobuchi's world, so it's already a very considerate measure.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p><span class="question">Questions 10:</span> I'm currently playing this game called <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII</em>, is there any way to get rid of this Social Interactions and Relationships system? Just because I pillaged a little bit and executed a person I didn't like, now no one wants to join me, no one wants to talk to me, and Sun Shangxiang won't even marry me. This is so weird!

    <p><span class="question">Questions 11:</span> It's a bit sudden, but can we please discuss this. I'm currently dying in a back alley, and suddenly this weird cane calling itself Kaleido Stick appears and says something like "make a contract with me, if we make this contract, not only will you not die, but some eggplant or mushroom guy will even make a game where I'm the main character." What should I do? Should I make the contract? [ Fuyuki &middot; Kotone ]</p>

Please understand the power of Urobuchi Gen, who faithfully followed the beginning of <em>Fate/stay night</em>'s story. But... to think he also copied its ending! That person really is a demon!

    </tr>

    <p><span class="question">Questions 14:</span> Is the reason Lancer didn't bring Moralltach and Beagalltach this time also because he (Kayneth) didn't listen to his wife? Would Beagalltach even be of use this time? [ Ireland  &middot; Pig of Ben Bulben ]</p>

Even though I'm jealous of your depravity and evilness, please be careful just in case, not everyone can live freely like you.

    <p><span class="question">Questions 16:</span> The middle-aged man of Fuyuki, Kiritsugu, holds two powers.

</div>

<div class="side-content">
    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:320px;"><span class="note">Fish and chips</span><br />
    Looks like he forgot fish and chips didn't exist around the time of King Arthur.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:70px;"><span class="note">Sky*et</span><br />
    Refers to Skynet from the <em>Terminator</em> series, a fictional artificial intelligence system that becomes self-aware and decides to terminate humanity.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:950px;"><span class="note">バゼット☆鍛</span><br />
    Bazett☆Tan, comes from <em>Fate/tiger colosseum</em>, where fans referred to Bazett as "破壊天使バゼットたん" (Angel of destruction Bazett-tan), which resulted in a barrage of videos on <a href="http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm1244544">Nico Nico Douga</a>, one of which decreed that "Xたん O鍛" (both are pronounced "tan," but 鍛 can also mean "forged"). Here it is unknown whether Nasu used this name because he saw the Nico video...</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="note">Ba Ji Quan</span><br />
    八極拳, a form of Chinese martial arts.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="note">Internal/External styles</span><br />
    In Chinese martial arts, internal styles focus more on elements such as mind, awareness, and "chi", where as external styles focus more on physical strength and agility. Read more about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styles_of_Chinese_martial_arts#External_and_Internal">here</a>. Here, Bazett from Fate/hollow ataraxia is interested in learning Kotomine's techniques, and her Servant, Avenger, is trying to talk her out of it.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="note">Killer of Saibane Fist</span><br />
    Saibane Fist (サイバネ拳法) is a term from Urobuchi/Nitro+'s <em>Kikokugai</em>. An "external" style where a person whose body has been partially replaced by robotic parts attain strengths impossible for normal humans. Killer of Saibane Fist (サイバネ 拳法殺し) is likely referring to how Kotomine's style is similar to Shidenshō (紫電掌), another <em>Kikokugai</em> technique where the user injects strong electromagnetic pulse into the opponent's body, destroying the eletronics of the mechanized body parts, similar to how Kiritsugu's Origin Bullets can destroy a mage's magic circuits. For Saibane Fist users it's a one-hit killing blow.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="note">Supersonic 6 Hit Fist</span><br />
    Likely another reference to <em>Kikokugai</em> (as is with most of Uro-related responses). Probably referring to 六塵散魂無縫剣, a supersonic sword technique of <em>Kikokugai</em>'s protagonist that is so fast it can cut down bullets fired from a machine gun.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="note">Fuyuki's Holy Virgin</span><br />
    Obviously <em>Fate/hollow ataraxia</em>'s Caren, here she's comparing <em>Hollow</em>'s Gilgamesh to <em>Fate</em>'s Gilgamesh.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="note">Father Mite</span><br />

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:0;"><span class="note">Fuyuki's Tiger</span><br />
    <em>Fate/stay night</em>'s Taiga.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:100px;"><span class="note">Itano Circus</span><br />
    Named after anime director Itano Ichirô, and primarily comes from the anime <em>Macross</em>, in which Itano created an attack where a ridiculously large number of missiles are launched at a target. It's usually characterized by the missiles' twisting, turning and crisscrossing contrails. Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzXfVgYCxWI">this video</a> to get a better idea.</p>

    <p class="footnote" style="margin-top:190px;"><span class="note">10 years later</span><br />
