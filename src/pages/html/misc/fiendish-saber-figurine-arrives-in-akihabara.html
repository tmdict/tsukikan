<p>In 2006, <a href="http://www.avg-hotgame.net/blogview.asp?logID=185">a figurine of Saber</a> (from <em>Fate/stay night</em>) given away as a "hand-made collector's edition item" by a Chinese comic magazine called <em>Donghua Jidi</em> (Anime Base) became <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/dqnplus/archives/811575.html">a hot topic of discussion</a> in both China and Japan. The cause of the debates was the figurine's ugly appearance. So spectacularly ugly was the figurine, some shops in Akihabara used the picture of the ugly Saber <a href="http://www.akibablog.net/archives/2006/10/pop_7.html">as advertisement and poster</a>.</p>

<p><u>Title</u>: Anime Base Fate/stay-night Special Issue Giveaway â€“ Hand-made Limited Edition Saber<br />
<u>Maker</u>: Anime Base Editorial Department<br />
<u>Price</u>: 30 Yuan (Magazine + Figure)</p>

<p>PC shop <a href="http://shopinfo.twotop.co.jp/akiba_honten/">Twotop</a> used the ugly Saber to <a href="http://scixx.blog27.fc2.com/blog-entry-512.html">demonstrate</a> the contrast ratio of liquid crystal display. Ugly Saber was shown as the low-contrast image, and a Saber figurine from ebCraft was shown as the high-contrast image. Manga shop Toranoana has put up a sign with ugly Saber that says: "Garbage has to be thrown into the can."</p>

<p>Saber is the heroine in <a href="http://www.typemoon.com/">Type-Moon</a>'s PC game "<a href="http://www.typemoon.com/product/fate/index.html">Fate/stay night</a>." Figurine of Saber is usually created by <a href="http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/hobby/ebcraft/">ebCraft</a>, famous for its great model, which usually sells out the moment it is announced.</p>

<p>According to the Chinese review site <a href="http://www.avg-hotgame.net/">HotGame</a>: "The most important part of a figurine is its face. This figurine's face is nothing but ugliness. I have never seen such an ugly face. It seems like some gene alteration was performed."</p>
