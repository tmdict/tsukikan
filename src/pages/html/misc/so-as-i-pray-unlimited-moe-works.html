<p><a href="http://www.typemoon.com/fate/chara/servant.html#servant02">Archer</a> is a popular character from <a href="http://typemoon.com/">Type-Moon</a>'s visual novel <em><a href="http://www.typemoon.com/fate/">Fate/stay night</a></em>. In the game, he is the Servant (someone who fights for his or her master) of Rin Tosaka, one of the series' main female casts. Archer is a skilled fighter at projectile weapons, and has a Reality Marble (think of a special sorcery that creates an alternate reality) called "<a href="http://lab.vis.ne.jp/tsukihime/data2/spell_03.html">Unlimited Blade Works</a>." To activate "Unlimited Blade Works," Archer first needs to complete a special chant.</p>

<p>Due to Archer's popularity, many variations of his chant can be found around the web made by fans.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.akibablog.net/">Akiba Blog</a> has posted two <a href="http://www.akibablog.net/archives/2007/06/archer-070629.html">interesting variations</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_%28Fate/stay_night%29">Archer</a>'s chant from stores found in Akihabara.</p>

<p>The first parody, titled "<a href="http://www.akibablog.net/archives/img-mouse/2007-06-29-404.jpg">Moe</a>," comes from the <a href="http://cgi.broccoli.co.jp/gamers/honten2/">Gamers</a> (Broccoli's retail stores) headquarters located in Akihabara, while the second one is <a href="http://www.akibaasobit.jp/storeinfo/hobby.html">AsoBit City</a>'s "<a href="http://www.akibablog.net/archives/img-mouse/2007-06-29-405.jpg">Plamo</a>" (Plastic Model).</p></p>

<p>The "Moe" chant is a promotion for the <em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/Fate-Stay-night%A5%D3%A5%B8%A5%E5%A5%A2%A5%EB%A5%B3%A5%EC%A5%AF%A5%B7%A5%E7%A5%F3/dp/4054034179">Fate/stay night Visual Collection</a></em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center"><strong>"Moe"</strong>
<p>I am the book of moe<br />
I am about Saber, but sometimes it's swimsuit<br />
I have created over a thousand sellouts<br />
Unknown to waste a page<br />
Nor known to losing a customer<br />
This book is always alone<br />
Personally intoxicated by Illyasviel<br />
Hence, withholding purchases is meaningless<br />

So as I prey, Unlimited Moe Works</p>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The "Plamo" chant was put out by the store to let people know the store sells plastic models on the 3rd floor.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="center"><strong>"Plamo"</strong>
<p>I am the bone of my plamo<br />
Plastic is my body, and paint is my blood<br />
I have crafted over a thousand plamo<br />
Unknown to negligence<br />
Nor to stop the fan<br />

Have withstood pain to create many plamo<br />
Intoxicated by thinner in a small room<br />
Yet, those hands will never be interested in ready-made plamo<br />
So as I pray, Unlimited Plamo Works</p>
</div>
