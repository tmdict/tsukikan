                This was recorded in a late night chat on January 26, 2001. Takeuchi Takashi, Nasu Kinoko, and OKSG took part. The theme was "Arcueid." Of course, there are lots of other things we talk about too, like salamanders and Sister-hime.

                If Arc takes off her limiter, she can probably materialize an entire small village in the mountains. But in modern towns that have been built up thanks to the work of many people, she has to destroy in order to create. More time is necessary. During this time, the Church would find her, then shout "Stop!" and then it'd become a war. It's very hard to face humans simply with Marble Phantasm. Maybe other creatures, but not humans. Honestly, though, Arc is like a God. A spirit in flesh.

                There are all types of True Ancestors, strong and weak. Arcueid can stand her ground with the first True Ancestor, so she's in a league of her own. By the way, the Marble Phantasm stuff is all connected to the "clustering illusion" theory of probability.

                So maybe it wasn't a perfect "chat."<br />
                It went on for two hours, but because of our page here and because "it'd be painful to see (laugh)" we omitted some parts. Both Takeuchi and Nasu's digressions were truly fantastic, though. (laugh) The chat ended without a single one of our questions being cleared up.<br />
                Toward the end, we were running out of time and had to rush a little. We ended up focusing on the theme, so we unfortunately didn't get to hear much from Takeuchi about the art.<br />
                Next time we'll focus more on addressing that.<br />
