                This was a late night chat that happened on March 3, 2001. It was the second staff chat, with the same three members: Takeuchi Takashi, Nasu Kinoko, and OKSG. The theme this time was "Ciel." There were some strange ideas, happenings, and nonsense spouted, but we actually covered a lot of ground!

                The novel where the world rules of 「Tsukihime」 and 「Kara no Kyoukai」 were originally created was the novel 「Mahoutsukai no Yoru」.<br />
                It was a story built around the concept "romantic + school life + magic + living together in a western house + mystery," a model for the Nasu Kinoko we know now.<br />
                It was written eight years ago, and at the time, Nasu Kinoko thought he wouldn't be able to write anything better than that for the next ten years.<br />
                In the end, he and others have acknowledged that.<br />
                The main character is the human missile launcher, Aozaki Aoko (a second-year in high school). She's the main character, yet she doesn't have any cute qualities.

For some reason, the scenario writer got to thinking Ciel = bow, but in the beta version for some reason it said "Ciel = sky," and "L'arc = bow." They couldn't change it at that point, so Ciel-senpai continued as Ciel-senpai.<br />
                As a result it was also decided that she was "good at air combat." Sky high!

                This one had too many ideas stuffed into it, so it fell apart, but the ideas Nasu and Takeuchi came up with at that time were later put into their works. Takeuchi's doujin manga 「Valkyria」 was born from this. Its title resembles 「Under a Limitlessly Blue Sky...」 (Hateshinaku Aoi, Kono Sora no Shita de...) but has nothing to do with it. The title actually comes from the band Soft Ballet. The secretary in question is Cipher Neuvelvourg. What a name.
