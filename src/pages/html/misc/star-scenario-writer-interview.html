<h1>Star Scenario Writer Interview</h1>

<div class="sub">

<p>『<a href="http://www.liar.co.jp/kusaritop.html">Kusarihime ~Euthanasia~</a>』 is a visual novel released by <a href="http://www.liar.co.jp/">Lair-soft</a> in 2002. The game was praised for its unique settings and the story. Soon after its release, 『Kusarihime』's scenario writer Hoshizora Meteo (who later joined TYPE-MOON to work on 『Girls' Work』) gathered several people from around the industry, including scenario writers Nasu Kinoko, Tanaka Romeo, and Urobuchi Gen, to talk about the game, which later resulted in a 『Kusarihime』 fanbook.</p>

<p>Inspired by their discussion of 『Kusarihime』, Romeo went on to create 『CROSS†CHANNEL』, Urobuchi Gen made 『Saya no Uta』, and Nasu came up with Heaven's Feel route for 『Fate/stay night』. Not only is 『Kusarihime』 is considered a classic, but it is also considered a cradle of other classics. The dialog </p>

<p>Below is the legendary talk that appeared in the 『Kusarihime』 fanbook. Note that the interview contains 『Kusarihime』 spoilers.</p>

                Thank you for gathering here today, everyone. We hardly ever have a chance to get together like this, so as we talk about 『Kusarihime』 today, I'd also like you to work in your own personal thoughts on writing, and any other  stories you might have. To start off, I'd like to ask each of you to explain what you liked about 『Kusarihime』...

                That's a tough question, because I liked it all. The first time I looked at the home page, I saw the words on the main image: "Euthanasia and Ruins." (<a id="1" href="#f1">*1</a>) That was enough to get me excited. Afterwards, I played the demo that came out in the beginning of 2002, and it really held up that image. The rural novel 『Shiki』 is a completely different medium and genre, (<a id="2" href="#f2">*2</a>) but that's really what it reminded me of. I expected it to be a story about a love-and-hate relationship in one closed setting. When I actually got the final version and played, it though, I was surprised that it was actually science-fiction dealing with cyclical time that still retained the themes I originally saw in it.

                When I saw that it began again right after it ended, I was like "What kind of a system is this game running on?" It really puzzled me. I thought I had to play through the entire game all over again. (LOL)

                I've always been a Liar-soft fan, so I was excited from the moment I saw the announcement. I entered this industry because of my love for "romantic"- style works like 『Kusarihime』, so the visuals really hit me hard. However, rather than the difficult subject matter, I was honestly more worried about how an experimental game like this would be able to be taken seriously in the 18+ bishoujo game environment we're in right now. Also, I wondered if they could really bring that visual image they originally had in their minds to life perfectly within the game. After playing, it, though, those thoughts immediately disappeared. The setting, the characters, honestly, everything was top quality... so today I came here basically to do nothing but flatter the people who made it. (LOL)

                I had a very firm vision from the beginning of this project as far as visuals go. I think I managed to visualize about 70% of it. Of course, there were many spots that I felt I sort of messed up, so I was surprised by so many people were worried about the "Moe!" aspect of it.

                They were certainly fresh when it was originally released. In the past, I did a lot of things with multiple characters on monotone backgrounds (<a id="5" href="#f5">*5</a>) that was completely the opposite of 『Kusarihime』.

                『Kusarihime』 didn't go for the traditional bishoujo game approach of "close-ups on the girl smiling," but rather just gives the information that she's there. It's certainly impossible to express everything all at once, but maybe it's just easier to give the absolute necessary amount of information and then say "OK, now imagine the rest." (LOL) It's a bit selfish, and it may seem like the users are being forsaken in a way.

                For example, with 『YU-NO』 <a id="6" href="#f6">*6</a> there was an image of a girl looking at a rock right in the center of the screen. At that time, only having one standing graphic of each character was typical. Everything was like that. I really like that sort of expression, though, so ever since I entered this industry I've been wanting to try and make a game like that, but people keep telling me stuff like "No one wants to play a weird game like that." (LOL) It's true, though, because in most bishoujo games these days, characters appear from their knees up.

                It may be hard to do games like that, but I wonder if rather, those types of games disappeared because those scenes don't appear in magazines. (<a id="7" href="#f7">*7</a>) It's really only the event scenes or the CG scenes that are used.

                Unless the backgrounds are done really well, those kinds of images won't have the right impact. They're actually really difficult to pull off, unless you're a very proactive creator like Nakamura-san who can really work them into the image itself.

                Meteo-san didn't really give me many orders. He sort of left things to me, or ignored me, I guess. So I thought, "I need to trust him back" and did my best. Later on, I was glad to be left to my own devices, because he actually started using me a lot. (LOL) Thinking about it now, I felt that being left alone helped me work better.

                I calculated that a manga artist could easily handle this much detailed standing graphics, and we ended up with twice the amount we originally  planned... looking back on my previous games, average graphics weren't paired  with backgrounds, we always had special individual CG prepared. That isn't how it's done these days so there's no way we could do that, but I did want to try and recreate that dramatic atmosphere that was present in my old works. Like put in voices during the bust profile CG, but have no voices in the standing  graphics. I thought that could abridge things and still leave an impact.

                The complete opposite of that, I suppose. Nitroplus' staff members are all very picky, however I do a lot of fixing bust profile CG images into  generic backgrounds. Taking this semiotic approach allows the scenario writer to struggle through to the very end. "Oh no, we need this kind of scene!" If that sort of problem arises, we can just rearrange the parts we've created up to now into something appropriate, to reflect his idea to the highest possible degree. And it really helps on our side if those symbols permeate through the users. Basically it's easier to run away from. (LOL)

                In my case, my staff is always there to help me, so it works out OK. For example, the CG team always just creates what they can and says "I guess it's ok for a first draft." But when they show it to me I'm like "Oh my god!" The scene we use them in would have to be pretty elaborate too. So in the end, they give me more wood for my fire as a scenario writer, and I'm really thankful. They just focus on what they're in charge of and leave the rest to other people. On the other hand, it seems to piss the other groups off.

                Being able to transmit your image through art also changes the approach you choose.

                In Naka-mura-san and Meteo-san's discussion (see page 47) you mentioned how 『Beneath the Endless Blue Sky...』 (<a id="15" href="#f15">*15</a>) was the summit, and how it couldn't be surpassed. Now I know exactly what that work has. It has the nostalgia and rustic locale that Urobuchi-san was talking about, yet it gives birth to a fear that slowly seeps through and turns everything upside down.

                It seems like the polygon staff always goes off the deep end and makes the 2D background staff suffer. "We can't use this background, there isn't enough shade!" and stuff like that. (LOL) So while we mostly operate with polygons, there are times when I think hand-drawn is a better choice.

On the surface, just seeing that character standing there is sad on its own. I wrote about this on my homepage (<a id="18" href="#f18">*18</a>), but this person understands that they have no future, yet in the end Natsuki-nee-san says stuff like "At Itsuki's wedding ceremony..." (<a id="19" href="#f19">*19</a>) that are just truly sad. I don't like talking about people who are dead, but she accepts she's going to die, and has lost the chance to experience the most important point in her life that's yet to come. So she isn't resisting it. I think it's a good scene. I could never write it on my own.

                (After a period of deep thought) ...if I were to talk about the romantic bits, I'd say because she's a "girl." She's strong at the core, and the oldest, so she has to protect Itsuki as a mother, so she NEEDS to be strong. It's a bit fleeting in a way. When she's disappearing while dancing happily with Itsuki at the end (<a id="24" href="#f24">*24</a>) it may have seemed a bit like her efforts were unrequited, but I like how the story made it seem like Yoshino was happy. At that point I was like "Damn it! They got me!" Also, when child Itsuki (<a id="25" href="#f25">*25</a>) comes back from preschool and says "I have two mothers," I was like "Ahhh, I love this!" ...that's the wholesome stuff. Honestly, I just like the erotic bits! (LOL)

For me, my mind really changed during my adolescence in middle school, but I haven't really felt how I've changed since then. However, I keep learning how to act like an adult, all the surface things I need to do. That's how everyone becomes an adult, but deep down, they haven't changed. So I thought, I'm going to try to express that with a female, who's an adult female on the outside but still a child on the inside.

The people share one mind, so if one decides "I guess I'll just die," and it's logical enough that it can't be refuted, then everyone says "Very logical," agrees, and decides to go with euthanasia.

On the good side, having a lot of explanation can sometimes hook the interest of the players, but I think about half of the script should be written from a player's point of view.

                It's often not smart to explain everything. And sometimes it ruins the rhythm of the story, so we avoided a lot. You have to leave the choice of where to cut off explanations and where to shorten things to the creators, and I don't think there are any completely right answers. I'm sure there are many people out there who think "『Kusarihime』 let me fantasize a lot, so I enjoyed it," while others will say "It didn't explain enough." You have to be smart and change things based on the current trends. That's the real job of the creators.

                A lot of people said "Juri = Kurame," and I really think that all comes from me not being able to draw enough difference between the two. They are two peas cut from the same pod, though. And I think in a very early stage I got some instruction that said "Juri is not an illusion that Kurame is creating, it's one that Itsuki is creating, that only the player can see."

                <br /><strong><a id="f1" href="#1">*1</a></strong>: Euthanasia and ruins... an important motif in 『Kusarihime』. The idea of euthanasia as the ultimate form of healing appears many times within the story. The ruins part signifies the place where Itsuki and the other characters' memories come from, the desolate feeling of having no one else around, and Itsuki's current state of a hollow mind and lost memories.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f2" href="#2">*2</a></strong>: 『Shiki』... A novel by Ono Fuyumi, published in 1998 by Sinchosha.

                <br /><strong><a id="f3" href="#3">*3</a></strong>: There was no opening movie... in the first shipment of 『Kusarihime』, the opening movie file was completely absent.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f4" href="#4">*4</a></strong>: Moe... generally refers to extreme attachment for mainly bishoujo  characters, but this has slowly come to encompass "easy-to-understand"  stereotypes like maids, priestesses, sister-in-laws, to fetishes like knee socks, eyepatches, or even crossdressing bishounen. Like Urobuchi-shi said in the interview, it can't be accurately defined anymore.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f5" href="#5">*5</a></strong>: His other representative works include the visual novels 『Rei</em>, 『Ato</em>, both released in 1996 by LEAF. These two works had CG character bust profiles on monotone backgrounds, exactly the opposite of 『Kusarihime』.<br />

Praised by fans for its moving story, it was also ported to a consumer game console.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f7" href="#7">*7</a></strong>: In magazines... it's usually the erotic scenes and the event CG from games that appear in bishoujo game magazines. Normally dialog scenes are almost never shown. Games with few erotic scenes just get the same CG repeated for months and months.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f8" href="#8">*8</a></strong>: Moaning... In some of the erotic scenes in 『Kusarihime』, there are moaning sound effects (?) that continually sound out.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f10" href="#10">*10</a></strong>: Images and music... They had the staff collect images and music from the net that fit the description to help convey their own personal images inside their minds. "Some people who are familiar with the sources we used may be able to figure it out right away, but we won't say any more," said Meteo-shi.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f11" href="#11">*11</a></strong>: Takeuchi-san... a fellow creator who caused a ripple in the industry with 『Tsukihime』. He is the representative of TYPE-MOON, which is currently producing 『Fate/stay night』.<br />

He even has cell phone wallpapers up for characters from 『Kusarihime』, so for fans it's a MUST-SEE: <a href="http://kazeyomitey.com/">http://kazeyomitey.com/</a><br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f19" href="#19">*19</a></strong>: Itsuki's wedding... When she turns into red snow and decays, there's a scene where Natsuki remembers the time she spent when Itsuki was a child. Then she speaks about the future that she will probably never experience. It's fantastic and beautiful, but also filled with sadness.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f20" href="#20">*20</a></strong>: The strongest... Kiriko's the only one who kicked away the other girls and tried to get Itsuki for herself. Is she using that crutch as a weapon?!<br />

Jun sits shivering with a blood-splattered hatchet which she used to murder Kurame, because she lost herself to her rising emotions. The point when her fear toward Kurame, who had controlled her up to that point changes to the fear toward the weight of what she did is especially superb.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f23" href="#23">*23</a></strong>: Mama transformed... a motif often used in Umezu Kazuo manga. When suddenly, your mother, who many people think is the closest person to them, suddenly changes her personality and scares you.<br />

                <br /><strong><a id="f24" href="#24">*24</a></strong>: Happily dancing... the scene right before Yoshino decays. Removed from all her shackles, she begins dancing around like a little girl. Then she turns into red snow and decays away.<br />

Yoshino heals her burning body with thoughts of Itsuki, despite being her own son, overlapped with the image of her old husband, Kenshou.

In the flashback scene "Planet of the Fire God" we see the girl who was the source of Kurame as a rotted corpse with pointed ears. Incidentally, Fire God refers to the Roman god of fire and blacksmithing, Vulcan.<br />

Those sliced by the red nail on the middle finger of Kurame's right hand eventually turn into red snow and decay.
