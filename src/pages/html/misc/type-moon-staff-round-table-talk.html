<p>A roundtable with all members of TYPE-MOON on August 2nd, 2002, back when TYPE-MOON was still a doujin group. The roundtable goes over TYPE-MOON's origin, its members and its history, as well as insider information on 「Tsukihime」 and 「Kagetsu Tohya」.</p>

We also entrust sound effects to him. As you can tell, he's the nicest looking guy in the group, though I guess I really mean that among those of us steeped in the business world, he has a unique edge to him. (laughs) And there are times when his edge is too strong and I don't know how to deal with it (all laugh), but I hope he can stay this way. Other than that, he is dying waiting for 「FF11」.

Though I suppose rather than friends who would play together, it was more like comrades in battle, which was why our bond was so deep.</td>

I was in a completely different division than KATE and Kiyobee, but we met in those dorms and became close. Kiyobee was next door to my room, so every morning he would wake me up. (laughs)<br />
        Soon after that the company got into financial trouble, so I decide to join a different company, and returned to Tokyo. At that point I began creating doujin with people I know, and that was when I got back together Nasu. Around that time those two also decided to quite the company, and haven't decided what to do yet, that was when us four got together and began making games.</td>

Following my senpai from the previous game company, I did some work related to network code and system architecture. The creation of 「Tsukihime」 felt like "everyone working to death at Takeichi-kun's place on the weekends, and finishing up the rest back home."</td>

        <td style="vertical-align:top"><span id="take">Takeuchi</span></td>
        <td>During 「Tsukihime Complete Edition」, aside from Nasu everyone had their feet on two different boats, so even meeting up was difficult. At that time KATE was in an especially inconvenient place so he couldn't come to us, and going there was bothersome, it was that kind of feeling. There was a massive amount of music and data, so work continued as he worked remotely. I would be told he finished the melody over the phone, but I could not get it at all over the phone. (laughs) I would try to listen to a song over the receiver and say, even if I say "Hey, this is good! Nasu, listen to this!" there's no way to really get it.<br />
        I always felt bad for Kiyobee too. Nasu and I did most of the work at night, but if it went past twelve Kiyobee would say "I'm tired," "I'm going to sleep," and "My brain cells are going to die." When someone says their brain cells are dying, there's really no way you can object to that. (all laugh) After all we can't take responsibility for Kiyobee's brain cells, so we'd let him stop work and go home. Sometimes when I would start doing a test play, it would suddenly freeze. Then I would call him up and ask him to fix it, this happened a lot, and was a mess until the very end.</td>

        I think the most important thing is teamwork. When it comes to a doujin circle company rules become more lenient, so choosing the right partners is the most important. Also social skills is also very important, although I don't think this count as a real advice, but basically instead of recruiting the required number of people and then operate, you should focus on members who can operate together before thinking of reaching the required people count.</td>

I was asked these questions in the past and spent some time thinking about it. First you must have an in-depth conversation with each member about their understanding of the work. If you neglect this and start working, it will become difficult later. Although this is something I need to reflect upon quite a bit as well. (all laughs) TYPE-MOON was very fortunate to have Kiyobee, as it's thanks to Kiyobee being here that things went so smoothly. He has such a high tolerance that it covered for everything else.
