An adventure game developed by Chunsoft and published by Sega first released on the Wii and later ported to PS3 and PSP. *428* (pronounced "Shibuya") is the spiritual successor to Chunsoft's *machi*, and involves the player playing from viewpoints of multiple characters.

*428* received high praise from critics and a perfect score in *Famitsu Weekly*. The game featured a special scenario by Nasu and Takeuchi, which was eventually adapted into the anime [*Canaan*](canaan-1.html).
