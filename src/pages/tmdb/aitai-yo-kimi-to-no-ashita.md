Second ending of the [*Fate/stay night* anime](fate-stay-night-1.html) and Tainaka Sachi's fourth single.

According to Sachi in *Newtype USA* 6, she felt that the greatest thing about singers is that they can express their true feelings honestly through melody and voice, and that she wrote the song "Aitai yo." to express her feelings when she had to leave the person she loved during the summer of 2006, by the time she finished writing them, her lyrics were soaked with tears.
