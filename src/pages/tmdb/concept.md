An artbook released at Comiket 75 to celebrate TYPE-MOON's 5th anniversary (as a commercial company) at Comiket. A collection of all the TYPE-MOON posters from past Comiket attendances from 2003 to 2008. According to Little Harlock:

> All the (re)visits to TYPE-MOON at Comike as featured within **CONCEPT** are presented in the same style whilst varying on terms of length and content. This means, each starts out with an opening double-page that presents you details about the specific event participation, such as date and booth number, Set content details plus these facts are accompanied by tiny icon size images of the TYPE-MOON Staff outfit (shirts, aprons, whatever they wore at the booth back then). Also each artwork collected features comments by the respective talent in charge, more on that during though within.
