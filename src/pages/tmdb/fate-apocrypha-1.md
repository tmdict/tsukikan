*Fate/Apocrypha* was originally an online RPG based on *Fate*'s Holy Grail War Master and Servant system, with details of settings and characters collected in [*Fate/complete material IV*](fate-complete-material-iv-extra-material.html). The online game was eventually canceled (and later revived as a mobile game called [*Fate/Grand Order*](fate-grand-order.html), but in November 2011 it was announced that the settings and stories would be released in the form of a light novel series written by Higashide Yuichiro and illustrated by Konoe Ototsugu.

The first chapter, "ACT 1: Unbirth," written by Yuichiro Higashide (character designer of Jack the Ripper in the original project), first appeared in [Volume 7](type-moon-ace-vol-7.html) of Kadokawa Shoten's *TYPE-MOON Ace*, with the story focusing on Jack the Ripper and her Master, Rikudou Reika. A preview of the novel was also included with [Volume 8](type-moon-ace-vol-8.html) of *TYPE-MOON Ace*.

Volume 1 was released during the 2012 winter Comiket 83 alongside [*Fire Girl*](fire-girl-1-a.html).
