A card-based online RPG for iOS and Android, *Fate/Grand Order*, codenamed "Fate Online Project Reboot", is a reboot of the [*Fate/Apocrypha*](fate-apocrypha-1.html) project that eventually turned into a novel series. The game features a large number of Servants, and has the player travel throughout history to participate in various Holy Grail Wars. The story is divided into seven chapters, only the first two chapters (along with the prologue) were available at release, with more chapters planning to be released following the game's launch at regular intervals.

The Android version was released at the end of July 2015 and was immediately met with criticism from users due to bugs, questionable gameplay mechanics, and downtimes caused by server issues and maintenance. DELiGHTWORKS, the company responsible for the game's development and server, came under heavy criticism for their poor planning. Many issues were fixed in the weeks that followed, with an iOS version released in mid-August.

On August 27th, TYPE-MOON announced that the game has been downloaded 3 millions times.
