Not to be confused with [*Fate/side material*](fate-side-material.html), *Fate/side side materiale* is a special book that came with the online order of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). It contains arts and writings from TYPE-MOON staff (many of which are quite comedic), as well as records of TYPE-MOON's transition from doujinshi to a commercial company, and more.

A PDF version of the book is available on TYPE-MOON's website. In 2011, this book was included in the compilation [*Fate/side side materiale complete*](fate-side-side-materiale-complete.html). The "e" at the end is to show this is not a serious material book.
