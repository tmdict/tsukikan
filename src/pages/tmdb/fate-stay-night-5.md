A 24-epidosde anime adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html) by Studio DEEN that aired from January 6 to June 16, 2006. While the anime took elements of all three routes from the visual novel, the main storyline followed that of the Fate route.

The adaptation was animated by Studio DEEN and produced by Fate Project, a group composed of Geneon Entertainment, TBS, CREi, TYPE-MOON, and Frontier Works Inc. The series premiered on the anime television network Animax in 2007. On July 3, 2008, the series was included in a deal announced by Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment to distribute select titles in North America, where Geneon Entertainment retained the license while Funimation Entertainment assumed exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles.

Eight DVD compilations, each containing three episodes, have been released in Japan, while six DVD compilations, each containing four episodes, were released by Geneon Entertainment in the U.S. Volume 5 of the DVD was released under the title *Fate/Stay Night 5: Medea*.

> In the aftermath of the last battle, only four Servants remain. Two of them inhabit Ryudou Shrine, making the next fight a dangerous one, as Shirou will have to face Assassin and Caster within their domain. Unfortunately, Shirou doesn't have time to strategize when one of his closest friends is taken there to be a sacrifice. Even with Saber and Rin by his side, Shirou rushes into battle at a great disadvantage while another Servant from Saber's past emerges onto the scene...

In 2010, the TV series was recompiled into two 60-minute special edition DVD/Blu-ray volumes to mark the theatrical release of [*Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works*](fate-stay-night-unlimited-blade-works-film.html). [*Fate/stay night TV reproduction I*](fate-stay-night-tv-reproduction-i.html) and [*II*](fate-stay-night-tv-reproduction-ii.html) featured re-edited and re-compiled content as well as new opening and ending sequences.
