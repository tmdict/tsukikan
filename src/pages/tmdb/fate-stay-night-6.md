A 24-epidosde anime adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html) by Studio DEEN that aired from January 6 to June 16, 2006. While the anime took elements of all three routes from the visual novel, the main storyline followed that of the Fate route.

The adaptation was animated by Studio DEEN and produced by Fate Project, a group composed of Geneon Entertainment, TBS, CREi, TYPE-MOON, and Frontier Works Inc. The series premiered on the anime television network Animax in 2007. On July 3, 2008, the series was included in a deal announced by Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment to distribute select titles in North America, where Geneon Entertainment retained the license while Funimation Entertainment assumed exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles.

Eight DVD compilations, each containing three episodes, have been released in Japan, while six DVD compilations, each containing four episodes, were released by Geneon Entertainment in the U.S. Volume 6 of the DVD was released under the title *Fate/Stay Night 6: The Holy Grail*. The limited edition DVD also included a "Saber clock" and 2 translucent mini pencil boards.

> The mysterious eighth Servant attacks, seeking to dominate Saber in order to claim her as his own. How will Shirou protect her? If they should ever win and obtain the Grail, Shirou and Saber would still have to choose between their own conflicted feelings and their self-imposed obligations, but will they even have that chance?

> Meanwhile, another figure lurks in the shadows, biding their time for when they can once again make an attempt for the elusive grail!

In 2010, the TV series was recompiled into two 60-minute special edition DVD/Blu-ray volumes to mark the theatrical release of [*Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works*](fate-stay-night-unlimited-blade-works-film.html). [*Fate/stay night TV reproduction I*](fate-stay-night-tv-reproduction-i.html) and [*II*](fate-stay-night-tv-reproduction-ii.html) featured re-edited and re-compiled content as well as new opening and ending sequences.
