[*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html), an 18+ visual novel released in January of 2004, is TYPE-MOON's first game since transforming from a doujinshi circle into a commercial company. The game was extremely popular, and became one of the best-selling galgame in 2004.

*Fate/stay night [Réalta Nua]* (Irish for "new star") is a PS2 port of the original *Fate/stay night*. All 18+ materials were taken out, new features include all-new CG and plots (including a secret ending titled Last Episode), voice acting, and other improvements.

On December 9, 2011, a PC version of *Réalta Nua* was announced. Three days later, TYPE-MOON announced that the new PC version, which will be updated and will feature new CGs and more, will be released as three separate games, each containing one of the game's routes ("Fate," "Unlimited Blade Works," and "Heaven's Feel"). During TYPE-MOON Fes. in summer of 2012, a PS Vita port of *Réalta Nua* was announced and later released in November of the same year. In May of 2015, the "Fate" route of *Réalta Nua* was made available for free on iOS and Android platforms until the end of June.
