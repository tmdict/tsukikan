Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

From Tokyopop:

> When high school student and amateur mechanic Shiro Emiya discovers that his foster father had been a magi, he decides to follow in his footsteps, despite his father's protestations and Shiro's lack of natural talent. Little does he know that a war is waging among the magi, and that he is about to become its focal point.

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.

From Viz Media:

> When he was little, high school student and amateur mechanic Shirou Emiya was adopted by a magus man.  Now he wants nothing more than to follow in his stepfather's footsteps and become a hero of justice.  Little does he know that a war is waging among some chosen magi, and that he is about to become its focal point... The manga addition to the super-popular multimedia franchise has finally arrived!
