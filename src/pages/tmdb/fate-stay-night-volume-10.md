Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

From Tokyopop:

> When high school student and amateur mechanic Shiro Emiya discovers that his foster father had been a magi, he decides to follow in his footsteps, despite his father's protestations and Shiro's lack of natural talent. Little does he know that a war is waging among the magi, and that he is about to become its focal point. No risk is too great, no sacrifice too high, and no spell too dangerous for these sorcerers whose sole purpose is to find the all-powerful Holy Grail, no matter the cost. Will Shiro be able to protect his city from the magi's destructive powers?

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.

From Viz Media:

> The battle between Emiya, Rin and the dangerous Caster has finally begun! In order to regain their servants, both under Caster's spell, the two must face unbeatable odds. Will they be able to destroy Caster and continue the Holy Grail War or will this battle be one they cannot win? The only things on their side are luck and their own ingenuity!
