Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.
