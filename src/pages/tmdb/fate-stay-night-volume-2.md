Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

From Tokyopop:

> After the deathly blow of Berserker, Emiya wakes up with a mysteriously recuperated body. That night, after Emiya took a blow to his stomach to save Saber, Einzbern let the battle go, promising to return again. As Emiya, Saber and Tosaka discuss the course of events, Tosaka warns Emiya of the realities of the Holy Grail War and reminds him that she is also in fact his enemy.

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.

From Viz Media:

> The Legend of the Grail continues! After suffering the deathly blow of Beserker, Emiya wakes up with a mysteriously healed body.  Determined to survive and defeat the Masters, Emiya sets out to unravel the mysteries of the Grail and how his past is tied to his new powers.  With enemies waiting in the wings, Emiya has no choice but to hurry and learn more about what he's gotten himself into if he's to have any chance of continuing on his quest...
