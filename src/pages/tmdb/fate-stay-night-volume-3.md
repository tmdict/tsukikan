Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

A limited 1st edition of volume 3 was released with a different cover, a Rider figurine, as well as a small staff booklet.

From Tokyopop:

> Emiya discovers the origin of the spell field only to be greeted by the Servant Rider, who controls the spell. Saber arrives to help fight, but the Rider escapes with hardly a scratch. Meanwhile, Tosaka proposes that she and Emiya join forces, to which Emiya agrees immediately. But will she still want to fight on Tosaka's side after she's kidnapped by Rider and discovers that the Rider's master is none other than her childhood friend Shinji?

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.

From Viz Media:

> The excitement continues as Emiya discovers the origin of the spell field only to be greeted by the Servant who controls it: Rider!  As she attacks, though, Rider carelessly discloses a secret about the field to Emiya.  Will Saber arrive in time to save Emiya from catastrophe? Meanwhile, our heroes discover something truly shocking as they scramble to find the cause of what ails the city of Shinto...
