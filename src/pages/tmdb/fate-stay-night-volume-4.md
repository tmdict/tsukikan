Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

From Tokyopop:

> When Emiya reaches the park in which he was saved by his father from the fire when he was young, Emiya and Saber are attacked by dragon fang soldiers, and Caster launches a sudden flash that envelops Saber. Saber and Emiya struggle to defeat Caster, a new Servant, and her army of endless dragon fang soldiers. But at the last blow, Saber realizes that Caster was just a mere puppet projection that the true Caster was controlling!

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.

From Viz Media:

> Shiro and Saber are in big trouble when they face off against Caster and her horde of undead soldiers.  Will they be able to defeat Caster on their own or will Rin have to save Shiro again?  And what will happen when the next Servant appears, and Saber chooses to defy Emiya's orders as her Master?
