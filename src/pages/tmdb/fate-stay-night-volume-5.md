Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

From Tokyopop:

> Shinji and Rider are up to no good again, and this time everyone is going to suffer. As Shiro wrestles with the dramatic changes in Shinji, he tries to change his old friend, believing that there's still good in him. Meanwhile, Shiro struggles to reconcile the growing complications in his relationship with Saber. What does it really mean to be Master and Servant, anyway?

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.
