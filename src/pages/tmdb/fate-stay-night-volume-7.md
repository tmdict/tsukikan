Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

From Tokyopop:

> As Shirou is falling off of the rooftop of the school, he uses his command mantra to summon Saber, who rescues Shirou and promises to defeat Rider. Meanwhile, Rin and Archer attack Shinji and Rider, pushing them to the edge of defeat. However, Saber blocks Archer's attack on Shinji under Shirou's orders. Emiya declares that he will protect Shinji, even if that means fighting Rin. But will he convince Shinji to cease his immoral acts?

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.

From Viz Media:

> Shinji is nearly defeated, but everyone is in for a surprise when Rider's true master is revealed! In the aftermath of Shinji's rage, Shiro learns about Saber's past and why her noble phantasm is what it is.  But are things finally calming down?  No one is prepared when Caster starts a new onslaught! Tosaka is determined to put an end to Caster's machinations, but it may prove harder than she ever imagined...
