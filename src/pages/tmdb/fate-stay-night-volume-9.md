Manga adaptation of [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The series, illustrated by Nishiwaki Datto, began serialization in the February 2006 issue of *Shounen Ace* (released on December 26, 2005), and loosely follows the Unlimited Blade Works route. Tokyopop licensed the manga in 2007 for North America.

From Tokyopop:

> After Emiya loses Saber to Caster, he becomes completely lost without direction and visits Fuyuki Church to receive advice from Kotomine. There, he learns that his foster father Kiritsugu was a Master 10 years ago. Although this causes conflict inside of him, he finds strength and decides that he must save Saber no matter what.

In April 2011, Tokyopop announced that they're shutting down their North American manga publishing division, and volume 11 became the last volume to be released by Tokyopop in the U.S. In 2014, Viz Media's Viz Select imprint announced that they will be releasing the *Fate/stay night* manga in digital form.

From Viz Media:

> Emiya and Rin have paired up in order to defeat Caster and regain their companions, but does Emiya have the strength to face a servant in battle? Can he even face his decision to let Saber be captured? With the help of Rin and an unexpected ally, the team may actually have a chance at winning if luck is on their side. What will it take to turn the tides of war in their favor? And just what is their new friend hiding from them...?
