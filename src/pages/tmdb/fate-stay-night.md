*Fate/stay night*, an 18+ visual novel released in January of 2004, is TYPE-MOON's first game since transforming from a doujinshi circle into a commercial company. The game was extremely popular, and became one of the best-selling galgame in 2004. In October of 2005, a fan disc titled [*Fate/hollow ataraxia*](fate-hollow-ataraxia.html) was released, and as with its predecessor, the fan disc broke sales records.

*Fate/stay night*'s success also made it one of TYPE-MOON's most heavily commercialized properties. An all-age PS2 port titled [*Fate/stay night [Réalta Nua]*](fate-stay-night-realta-nua.html) was released in 2007. During the 2006 winter Comiket, the first volume of [*Fate/Zero*](fate-zero-1.html), a 4-volume prequel novel to *Fate/stay night*, was released. Other spin-off games include the 3D fighting game [*Fate/unlimited codes*](fate-unlimited-codes.html) and the dungeon RPG [*Fate/Extra*](fate-extra.html). There is also a huge line of merchandise, books, accessories, dolls, cards, as well as manga and anime adaptations.

The game was originally released on 3 CDs, but was later re-released on DVD in 2006. The 1st edition of the game came with a visual data book.
