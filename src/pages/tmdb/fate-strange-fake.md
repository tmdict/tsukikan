A [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html) side story/fanfiction by Narita Ryougo (author of *Baccano*) that came with [*TYPE-MOON Ace Vol. 2*](type-moon-ace-vol-2.html). Later the story was published both as a [novel](fate-strange-fake-1.html) under Dengeki Bunko as well as a [manga series](fate-strange-fake-volume-1.html) under TYPE-MOOB Books, a short trailer was also created to accompany the releases.

The story itself is not canon, but does provide an interesting take on the Holy Grail War. The story, which is intended to be the introduction to a role-playing game, was originally posted as a fanfiction on Narita's homepage under the title *Fake/states night* as an April Fool's joke. The version included with *TYPE-MOON Ace Vol.2* features illustrations by Morii Shizuki as well as an afterword by the author.

The story centers around an artificially engineered Grail War that was copied from the third Fuyuki Grail War by a mage organization in the United States, and takes place in a small town in California 10 years after the events of [*Fate/hollow ataraxia*](fate-hollow-ataraxia.html).
