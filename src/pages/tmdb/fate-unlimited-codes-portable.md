An adaptation of [*Fate/unlimited codes*](fate-unlimited-codes.html) for the PlayStation Portable. A downloadable (not UMD) North American version of the game was released on September 3, 2009 on PSN.

The PSP version contains all the features found in the PS2 version along with a number of improvements. The gameplay has been tuned for the PSP. New gameplay elements include the new "Reflect Dash" move, which allows the player to press forward on the D-pad simultaneous with the Reflect Guard button to dash forward while blocking the character's upper body.
