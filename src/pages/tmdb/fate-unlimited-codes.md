A 3D fighting game based on the [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html). The game was developed by Eighting/Raizing and released by Capcom, and was later ported to PS2 and [PSP](fate-unlimited-codes-portable.html). While the game is 3D, each match is mostly fought on a 2D plane, with the option to sidestep (which is nor nearly as effective as it should be).

A PS2 port of the game was released at the end of 2008. The port introduced 3 new characters not seen in the arcade version, as well as new character outfits and the inclusion of Story Mode, Mission Mode, Gallery, and several mini games.
