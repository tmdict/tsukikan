*Fate/Zero* is a collaboration project between TYPE-MOON and Nitro+. The 4-volume novel serves as the prequel to [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html), with the story written by Nitro+'s Urobuchi Gen, and the art drawn by TYPE-MOON’s Takeuchi. Due to its success, the novel series was later adapted into an anime by ufotable.

Volume 1 of *Fate/Zero* was released during the 2006 winter Comiket (C71), and came with a material book called [*material/Zero*](material-zero.html).
