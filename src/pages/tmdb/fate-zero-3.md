Volume 3 of *Fate/Zero*, a collaboration project between TYPE-MOON and Nitro+, released during the 2007 summer Comiket (C72). The 4-volume novel serves as the prequel to [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html), with the story written by Nitro+'s Urobuchi Gen, and the art drawn by TYPE-MOON’s Takeuchi. Due to its success, the novel series was later adapted into an anime by ufotable.
