Also known as *Alliance of Illusionary Eyes*, a free downloadable short story by Nasu that takes place about two months after the events in [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html). The game was originally released as part of [*PLUS-DISC*](tsukihime-plus-disc.html) in January 2001. According to Mirror Moon:

> Prior the release of Tsuki-Bako, Kiyobei, the lead programmer at TYPE-MOON, wanted to shift from NScripter to a more versatile script engine (KiriKiri2), but was unsure as to how it would perform speed-wise, so Alliance of Illusionary Eyes was also released to the public as part of an evaluation test for the KiriKiri2 script engine in 2002.

> Upon finishing the story, people were asked to complete a survey detailing their experiences in using the evaluation test, and from that point onwards, starting with Tsukihime Plus+Disc, TYPE-MOON started to use KiriKiri2 as their main script engine for future projects.
