A game announced in April 2008 as part of "the next worlds of TYPE-MOON." According to the announcement, unlike TYPE-MOON's previous games, the main character of the game would be a city called Shinjuku, which has become a city similar to Paris. The game would be a non-ero game. TYPE-MOON would only be involved in the production of the game, while the game itself would be written by Hoshizora Meteo and Myogaya Jinroku, and drawn by someone other than Takeuchi. In effect, even though the game would carry the TYPE-MOON label, it would be made by anything but TYPE-MOON.

While no major announcement regarding the game was released since then, in December 2010, a *Girls' Work* anime was announced in [*TYPE-MOON Ace* Vol.6](type-moon-ace-vol-6.html). The anime will be handled by ufotable, with Takenashi Eri as the main artist and the story written by Meteo Hoshizora.

Since Hoshizora, along with Kimura Kou (both ex-Lair-soft staff), were supposed to be the writers for the *Girls' Work* game that was announced in 2008, many are speculating that the game project has been turned into an anime project.
