Part 2 of *Kara no Kyoukai*, a popular novel written by TYPE-MOON's Nasu with cover and illustration by Takeuchi, it is considered by many to be Nasu's debut work as a writer. Sometimes referred to by its nickname *Rakkyo* (らっきょ), *Kara no Kyoukai* shares the same view with Nasu's later works [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html) and [*Fate/stay night*](fate-tay-night.html), and many similarities can be found within their background setting and character designs.

*Kara no Kyoukai* was first serialized on Nasu and Takeuchi's doujin site Takebouki between October 1998 to May 1999 as a doujin novel, where new chapters were released on a monthly basis. After the first five chapters were published on the Internet, the final two chapters were released at the 1999 summer Comiket (C56). In 2001, a portion of the novel was released with the [*Tsukihime PLUS-DISC*](tsukihime-plus-disc.html) and reactions were positive, resulting in the novel being published as a doujin novel during the 2001 winter Comiket (C61). In 2004 *Kara no Kyoukai* was re-published as a 2-volume commercial novel by Kodansha, the letters in the new books are slightly bigger than the doujin version's.
