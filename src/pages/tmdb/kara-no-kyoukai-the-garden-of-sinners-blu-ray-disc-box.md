In late August, a mysterious 24-hour timer counting down appeared on the official *Kara no Kyoukai* website. Fans debated what kind of announcement awaited the public at the end of the countdown, some say it's the anime adaptation of "[Mirai Fukuin](kara-no-kyoukai-mirai-fukuin.html)," others think it's about a Blue-ray disc (those who were more observation declared that the announcement, which turned out to be about the Blue-ray Disc, had already been mentioned in [*Type-Moon Ace 5*](type-moon-ace-vol-5.html)).

A day later on the 27th of August (midnight on Friday in Japan), the big announcement was unveiled. A complete Blu-ray Disc Box set will be released on the 2nd of February 2011, and that it will come with a bonus disc with the final chapter of *Kara no Kyoukai* (a standalone DVD release for the final chapter was also announced). The set would also come with a 60-minute edited *Remix - Gate of Seventh Heaven-* compilation of the first six films and the 50-minute Retracing All Seven Chapters of The Garden of Sinners television special, new cover art exclusively drawn by Takeuchi, as well as a Visual Chronicle Book that contained staff interviews, key visuals, illustrations from each movie, and artwork for DVD packages. The package will include English subtitles as well.

In December of 2010, Aniplex of America announced that a North America release of the Blue-ray box set, complete with an extra booklet of just English translations of the Japanese text from the Deluxe Visual Chronicle Book. Before the release, one of the local distributors asserted that the $300+ price (the box set was priced at $398.98) was ridiculously high in the U.S. and that nobody would purchase it. In early 2011, the President of ufotable Kondo Hikaru announced through ufotable's official web diary that the Blu-ray box sets of *Kara no Kyoukai* have sold out in the US.
