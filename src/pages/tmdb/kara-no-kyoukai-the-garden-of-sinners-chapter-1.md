Toward the end of 2006, rumors began circulating that TYPE-MOON's novel [*Kara no Kyoukai*](kara-no-kyoukai-1-the-garden-of-sinners.html) would be adapted into an anime TV series after Ryogi Shiki, the main character of *Kara no Kyoukai*, appeared in the 2007 Illustration Calendar of the anime magazine *Newtype*, and a pin-up poster was announced to appear in the following issue. On December 28th, 2006, an official website of *Kara no Kyoukai* opened at www.karanokyoukai.com, announcing the new adaption as a feature film *Kara no Kyoukai ~Garden of Sinners~*, animated by the studio ufotable.

In March 2007, the website was re-newed, and announced that instead of a single film, *Kara no Kyoukai ~Garden of Sinners~* would be a 7-part movie series, with the film covering all seven chapters of the original novel. While film adaptations of popular novels and games was common in Japan, at the time it was very rare to see a single work being adapted into a seven-part movie series.

Not only did each DVD box feature artworks by Takeuchi, the box also came with a OST CD for that chapter, a special booklet containing artworks.

> -September, 1998  
> In the city where Shiki lives, something triggers a spate of mysterious schoolgirl suicides. The connection between the girls who leapt to their deaths is unclear, although all of them have jumped from the Fujou Building, a skyscraper scheduled to be demolished. Meanwhile, Mikiya, after having gone near the Fujou Building, has fallen into a coma. Shiki heads to the Fujou Building herself to save Mikiya. And waiting for her there…is Kirie Fujou. The girls' suicides and Mikiya's coma were all caused by Kirie. Terminal illness had left her bedridden and immobile in a hospital, but one day, she acquires a spiritual body, a separate entity from herself.
