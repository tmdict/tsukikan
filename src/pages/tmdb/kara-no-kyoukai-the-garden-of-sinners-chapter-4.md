Toward the end of 2006, rumors began circulating that TYPE-MOON's novel [*Kara no Kyoukai*](kara-no-kyoukai-1-the-garden-of-sinners.html) would be adapted into an anime TV series after Ryogi Shiki, the main character of *Kara no Kyoukai*, appeared in the 2007 Illustration Calendar of the anime magazine *Newtype*, and a pin-up poster was announced to appear in the following issue. On December 28th, 2006, an official website of *Kara no Kyoukai* opened at www.karanokyoukai.com, announcing the new adaption as a feature film *Kara no Kyoukai ~Garden of Sinners~*, animated by the studio ufotable.

In March 2007, the website was re-newed, and announced that instead of a single film, *Kara no Kyoukai ~Garden of Sinners~* would be a 7-part movie series, with the film covering all seven chapters of the original novel. While film adaptations of popular novels and games was common in Japan, at the time it was very rare to see a single work being adapted into a seven-part movie series.

Not only did each DVD box feature artworks by Takeuchi, the box also came with a OST CD for that chapter, a special booklet containing artworks.

One day, Shiki is visited by Touko Aozaki, a wizard and proprietor of a studio called "Garan no Dou." Due to the loss of her alternate personality, Shiki has lost not only any memory of her accident, but also any real sense that she's alive and spends her days as a mere empty shell of herself. Strange, enigmatic beings begin to attack her, trying to take control of her body, now that her soul is hollow. However, one day, she confronts the attackers who've resorted to force and Shiki makes the decision to fight of her own volition.
