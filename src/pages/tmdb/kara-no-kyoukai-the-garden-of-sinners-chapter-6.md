Toward the end of 2006, rumors began circulating that TYPE-MOON's novel [*Kara no Kyoukai*](kara-no-kyoukai-1-the-garden-of-sinners.html) would be adapted into an anime TV series after Ryogi Shiki, the main character of *Kara no Kyoukai*, appeared in the 2007 Illustration Calendar of the anime magazine *Newtype*, and a pin-up poster was announced to appear in the following issue. On December 28th, 2006, an official website of *Kara no Kyoukai* opened at www.karanokyoukai.com, announcing the new adaption as a feature film *Kara no Kyoukai ~Garden of Sinners~*, animated by the studio ufotable.

In March 2007, the website was re-newed, and announced that instead of a single film, *Kara no Kyoukai ~Garden of Sinners~* would be a 7-part movie series, with the film covering all seven chapters of the original novel. While film adaptations of popular novels and games was common in Japan, at the time it was very rare to see a single work being adapted into a seven-part movie series.

Not only did each DVD box feature artworks by Takeuchi, the box also came with a OST CD for that chapter, a special booklet containing artworks.

> -January 1999  
> Apprentice mage Azaka Kokutou, Mikiya’s younger sister, has been ordered by her mentor, Touko Aozaki, to investigate a certain incident in which fairies steal the memories of students at Azaka's school, Reien Academy. Azaka launches an investigation with the help of Shiki who can see fairies. As the investigation proceeds, Shiki finds out that Misaya Ouji, a student body president, is the one who controls fairies. However, the mastermind who gave her the power is Satsuki Kurogiri, a magus who controls words. Ironically, thanks to Satsuki’s magic, Shiki remembers that she had encountered Souren Araya and what he had told her two years ago.
