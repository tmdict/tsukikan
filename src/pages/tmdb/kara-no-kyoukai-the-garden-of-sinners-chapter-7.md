Toward the end of 2006, rumors began circulating that TYPE-MOON's novel [*Kara no Kyoukai*](kara-no-kyoukai-1-the-garden-of-sinners.html) would be adapted into an anime TV series after Ryogi Shiki, the main character of *Kara no Kyoukai*, appeared in the 2007 Illustration Calendar of the anime magazine *Newtype*, and a pin-up poster was announced to appear in the following issue. On December 28th, 2006, an official website of *Kara no Kyoukai* opened at www.karanokyoukai.com, announcing the new adaption as a feature film *Kara no Kyoukai ~Garden of Sinners~*, animated by the studio ufotable.

In March 2007, the website was re-newed, and announced that instead of a single film, *Kara no Kyoukai ~Garden of Sinners~* would be a 7-part movie series, with the film covering all seven chapters of the original novel. While film adaptations of popular novels and games was common in Japan, at the time it was very rare to see a single work being adapted into a seven-part movie series.

Not only did each DVD box feature artworks by Takeuchi, the box also came with a OST CD for that chapter, a special booklet containing artworks.

> -February 1999  
> Shiki awakes from her coma and starts to live a new life. Meanwhile, a series of murders are occurring after four years of silence. "Who is the murderer?" The incidents remind her of a murderous impulse hidden inside her soul and "SHIKI," her lost alternate persona. While Shiki searches for a suspect, Mikiya also starts an investigation of his own to prove Shiki is innocent. As he follows a lead of a drug dealer, Mikiya comes across Rio Shirazumi, who was a senior at his high school. Mikiya finds out that Rio is the one who sells the drug called “blood chip” and tries to convince him to stop, but he is instead harmed by Rio.
