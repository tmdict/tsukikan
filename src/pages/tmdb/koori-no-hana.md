A novel by Nasu that's read by even less people than the original [*Mahoutsukai no Yoru*](mahoutsukai-no-yoru.html) scripts. The story is said to be "Just like the title, a beautiful but cold story." About a knight, has nothing to do with magic. When asked about his early works, Nasu once said that the only presentable works (novels) are *Kara no Kyoukai*, *Mahou Tsukai no Yoru*, and *Koori no Hana*.
