The first doujinshi released by the then newly established circle RubiconHearts (whose mission statement is to show the beauty of printed art with a presentation that digital art cannot yet capture) at the end of 2010 at Comiket 77, *Kyoto, Spring.* features original illustrations by TYPE-MOON artists Takeuchi Takashi and *School Rumble* mangaka Kobayashi Jin.

TYPE-MOON, trying to finish Mahoyo, did not attend C77. However, Takeuchi ended up dragging his friend Kobayashi to C77 anyways, not only to make some money selling doujinshi, but also to fulfill a promise they made the previous spring. That spring, Takeuchi and Kobayashi spent a day in Kyoto. When they returned from the trip, the two agreed to capture the beauty of springtime Kyoto through art. As a result, using their free time near the end of the year, the two artists created the artbook *Kyoto, Spring.*.

The topic of the book is based on the scenes Takeuchi and Kobayashi's experienced in Kyoto, mixed with illustrations of girls from both. While Takeuchi and Kobayashi are the main artists, an entire team of color artists and background illustrators were required to produce the final product (apparently Kobayashi did all of his own coloring and finishing, while several artists finished Takeuchi's illustrations).

The book sold out within 20 minutes during Comitia 91 on February 14, 2010, and a *postscript of Kyoto in the spring.* copy book sold equally well. Since February 27, 2010, stores in Akihabara began selling *Kyoto, Spring.* at 2,400 yen, and *postscript of Kyoto in the spring.* at 600 yen, both has since been sold out.

The copy book *postscript of Kyoto in the spring.* contains some setting materials and sketches for the doujinshi. According to the settings, the name of the blond girl in the main book is Ariel.

Kobayashi:

> I had a strong feeling to do a doujinshi. To me, creative works outside of commercialization are becoming too idealistic. In a gathering with a lot of people, it would be great if your work can leave a positive impression on people even if no one recognizes you. Works that are too simple won't catch people's attention, since this time it's a collaboration with Takeuchi-sensei, even though I was a bit nervous, I was able to draw without worry. You can't procrastinate when working with the unchanging enthusiastic Takeuchi-sensei!

Takeuchi:

> I have always wanted to once again create original doujinshi. That feeling had always been "always felt like," and so it is true that "always felt like" will never become a reality. It was Kobayashi-sensei's "Let's go to Kyoto! See cherry blossom, then publish a book!" that finally made my "always felt like" self wake up. I was like someone who found it hard to talk about it yet at the same time filled with excitement. This was a feeling that I constantly felt 10 years ago. I think this is how going back to one's root feels like. It will be good if this book can make at least some people feel special.
