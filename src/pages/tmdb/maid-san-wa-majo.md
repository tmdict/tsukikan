Also known as *The Maid-san is a Witch*, *Maid-san wa Majo* is a doujinshi drew by Takeuchi (who loves maids) after the release of [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html). The work was released under Nasu and Takeuchi's doujin circle Bamboo Broom (竹箒), and is about a powerful sorceress being forced to wear an "Absolute Obedience Maid Uniform."

Also contains a reprint of the doujin [*Lucky Maid-S*](lucky-maid-s.html) by Takeuchi.
