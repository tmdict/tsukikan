An arcade port of [*Melty Blood Re-ACT*](melty-blood-re-act.html) by Sega-Sammy with the backing of TYPE-MOON and French Bread and marketed by Ecole. Came with with a more polished system, new scenarios and new characters (Kouma, Aozaki Aoko and NecoArc). A PS2 version was later released, and was later ported back to the arcade as [*Act Cadenza Ver.B*](melty-blood-act-cadenza-ver-b.html).

This was the first [*Melty Blood*](melty-blood.html) game to be released as an arcade game (for Sega NAOMI), and later the first *Melty Blood* game on a console. This was also the first *Melty Blood* game not developed by French Bread.

A PS2 port of *Act Candenza* was released in 2006, marking the first time a *Melty Blood* game appeared on a console.
