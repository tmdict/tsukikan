The third game in the [*Melty Blood*](melty-blood.html) series. Gameplay changes were implemented, including three different fighting styles for each character: Full Moon Style (Power), Crescent Moon Style (Speed) and Half Moon Style (Simple), a defense bar that indicates how much damage a character can take while defending, and a wider area. Two new characters, Riesbyfe Stridberg (Vampire Hunter of the Church and a colleague of Sion) and Michael Roa Valdamjong, were added to the game.

A PS2 port of the game was released in 2009. One of the highlight of the game was the inclusion of [*Kara no Kyoukai*](kara-no-kyoukai-1-the-garden-of-sinners.html)'s Ryougi Shiki as one of the playable characters. The limited 1st edition of the PS2 port came with [2 soundtrack CDs](all-over-melty-blood.html).
