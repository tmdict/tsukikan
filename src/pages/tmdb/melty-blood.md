A 2D fighting game based on [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html). Originally a collaboration between TYPE-MOON and French Bread (known as Watanabe Seisakujo before 2003), the game was originally released at the 2002 winter Comiket (C63) as a doujin fighter. An expansion patch called [*Re-ACT*](melty-blood-re-act.html) was released two years later in May 2004, and a patch called Final Tuned was later released for free in July 2005.

While the game was developed by French Bread, TYPE-MOON was closely involved with its production, with character design and CG by Takeuchi, music by KATE, and most importantly, script by Nasu. Even though in name this is a *Tsukihime* doujin, in reality it had more or less become an official TYPE-MOON game. It also played a big role in promoting the popularity of *Tsukihime*.

Thanks to its balanced gameplay, high production quality (60 FPS for a doujin game at the time), and fluid control, *Melty Blood* became a popular fighting game among fans and received many praise, and tournaments were held in various places in Japan. The *Re-ACT* patch further increased the game's success. In 2006, the popular international fighting game tournament Tougeki began featuring *Melty Blood* as one of its events.

Originally, only six characters were playable, with eight more being unlockable through Story Mode. A later update (the "Nero" patch) all the characters playable from the start. Some speculate that the reason for this patch was due to a legal misunderstanding, where TYPE-MOON mistakenly thought they would no longer be allowed to produce updates/patches, and thus made a "last patch" that unlocked the characters as a gift to the fans.

On March 2005, an arcade version of the game titled [*Melty Blood Act Cadenza*](melty-blood-act-cadenza.html) was released by Ecole Software, which was ported to PlayStation 2 in 2006. An update of *Act Cadenza*, entitled [*Act Cadenza Ver.B*](melty-blood-act-cadenza-ver-b.html), was released in the arcades in December 2006 and later ported to the PC in 2007. The latest installment, [*Melty Blood Actress Again*](melty-blood-actress-again.html), was released by Ecole in September 2008 in Japan. *Melty Blood* has also been adapted into a manga series drawn by Kirishima Takeru and serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's *Comp Ace*.
