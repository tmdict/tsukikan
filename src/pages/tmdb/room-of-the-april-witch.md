Also known as *Shigatsu no Majo no Heya*. Originally an April Fool's Day project, TYPE-MOON announced in October 2011 that Meteo Hoshizora's short story *Room of the April Witch* would be published by Saikeisha as a book.

The story is about a witch named April with the power to turn lies into reality. Due to this terrifying power, April is confined in a small house. However, once a year on April 1, April opens the door to her house to visitors.

The book comes with a CD of Sakamoto (a well-known singer and voice actress) reading the book.
