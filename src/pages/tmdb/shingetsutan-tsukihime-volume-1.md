Manga adaptation of [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html) with story and art by Shonen Sasaki. The manga began serialization in ASCII Media Works' *Dengeki Daioh* December 2003 issue, and ended in the September 2010 issue of *Dengeki Daioh*. There are a total of 10 volumes (73 chapters).

The manga was licensed in the U.S. ComicsOne in 2004 as *Lunar Legend Tsukihime*. The license was taken over by DrMaster in 2005.

Below is a summary from the English version of the manga:

> A childhood accident has left young Shiki Tohno with a very special ability. He can now see the hidden lines or weak points in all things -- be they organic or inanimate. By striking or cutting along these lines Shiki can slice through virtually anything like a hot knife through butter. Unfortunately the gift comes packaged with a nearly irresistible urge to kill using this new ability.

> In the very first volume, a young girl falls prey to Shiki's killing lust. Yet she is apparently reborn unharmed and demanding Shiki's aid. Who is she and what could she want? More importantly, what is the fanged darkness, which shadows her every step?
