Manga adaptation of [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html) with story and art by Shonen Sasaki. The manga began serialization in ASCII Media Works' *Dengeki Daioh* December 2003 issue, and ended in the September 2010 issue of *Dengeki Daioh*. There are a total of 10 volumes (73 chapters).

The manga was licensed in the U.S. ComicsOne in 2004 as *Lunar Legend Tsukihime*. The license was taken over by DrMaster in 2005.

Below is a summary from the English version of the manga:

> To repay for cutting her to pieces on their first encounter, Shiki sides with Arcueid in the battle between the True Ancestors and the Dead Apostles. But Shiki's "Lines of Death" do not seem to work on Nero Chaos whose life form is a collective body of 666 beasts. Everything seems to fail as Arcueid is trapped in Nero's “Live Creation Soil” and Shiki is mauled by the beasts. On the verge of losing his consciousness, Shiki begins to see “points” that form within a bundle of the "Lines of Death".
