Manga adaptation of [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html) with story and art by Shonen Sasaki. The manga began serialization in ASCII Media Works' *Dengeki Daioh* December 2003 issue, and ended in the September 2010 issue of *Dengeki Daioh*. There are a total of 10 volumes (73 chapters).

The manga was licensed in the U.S. ComicsOne in 2004 as *Lunar Legend Tsukihime*. The license was taken over by DrMaster in 2005.

Below is a summary from the English version of the manga:

> Shiki has brought death upon Nero Chaos and peace has been restored in the city... or so it seemed. To the disappointment of Shiki, the victims of vampire attacks continue to increase in the city, and the only vampire Shiki could think of is Arcueid. Is this Arcueid's doing or is there another vampire around? And why does Shiki's high school idol Ciel like curry so much? And why is Shiki's sister so formal? Mysteries abound and their true identities are revealed in this volume as they all scramble over Shiki.
