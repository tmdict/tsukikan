Below is a summary from the English version of the manga:

> After a furious bout that displayed Akiha's powerful pyrokinetic ability, Ciel is convinced Akiha is not the vampire she was seeking. Meanwhile, Shiki begins to dream of bloody nightly rampages and wonders if he is Roa. Ciel surprises Shiki by revealing her true identity as the Burial Agent from the Church and reassures Shiki that he is not Roa. Shiki finds comfort in Arcueid as they continue to hunt for Roa, but becomes worried when he begins to see the thread of life reappear on Arcueid. His nightmare soon becomes reality when he encounters a strange man who attacks him with a knife aiming at his thread of life…
