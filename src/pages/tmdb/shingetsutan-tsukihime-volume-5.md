Manga adaptation of [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html) with story and art by Shonen Sasaki. The manga began serialization in ASCII Media Works' *Dengeki Daioh* December 2003 issue, and ended in the September 2010 issue of *Dengeki Daioh*. There are a total of 10 volumes (73 chapters).

The manga was licensed in the U.S. ComicsOne in 2004 as *Lunar Legend Tsukihime*. The license was taken over by DrMaster in 2005.

Below is a summary from the English version of the manga:

> After rescuing Shiki from his dangerous encounter with Roa, Ciel warns him in vain to stay away from Arcueid, who may have an ulterior motive. Meanwhile, Shiki cannot shake off the feeling that he knows Roa, and a visit to the garden of his house jolts his memory, piercing him with visions of Roa as a child, along with a voice telling him that he will become a "true monster" someday.
