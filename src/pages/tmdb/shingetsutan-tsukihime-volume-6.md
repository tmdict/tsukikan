> In volume six, the violent bloody action continues when Shiki loses control of his senses and reveals his true "monster" nature within him as he goes on a mad killing spree. Subsequently, Shiki begins to recall fragments of his childhood memories, which reveal some important secrets of the Tohno family.

> Just when Shiki collapses from his killing spree, Roa appears with the intention of killing him, but Akiha tries desperately to protect Shiki. Ciel later joins the fight against Roa, and more secrets of Ciel’s painful past are revealed. Don’t miss out on all the blood, gore and supernatural action in the sixth volume of Lunar Legend Tsukihime!
