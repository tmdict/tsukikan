A specially package that comes with [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html), [*PLUS+DISC*](tsukihime-plus-disc.html), [*Kagetsu Tohya*](kagetsu-tohya.html), a remixed soundtrack, and other bonus content.

It was released to mark the end of TYPE-MOON's 4 years' activity as a doujin group, prior to the group's transition into a commercial company. After its release, the package became known for its extremely high price on sites like eBay.
