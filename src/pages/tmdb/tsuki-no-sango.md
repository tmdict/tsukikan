*Tsuki no Sango* (*Moon's Coral*) is a short sci-fi novel written by Nasu for Maaya Sakamoto's Full Moon Recital Hall (organized by Saizensen). The event featured Sakamoto reading the short novels in a theater accompanied by animations in the background. The recital of *Tsuki no Sango* took place on December 21, 2010, and was aired live on Ustream. The background animation was animated by ufotable. There was also a 42-page booklet containing the story with illustrations by Takeuchi and Aikura.

The book, as well as a CD of the recital, was released in October 2011.
