Sold for 300 yen, a special fan disc released as an addition to [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html). It contained the early trial versions of *Tsukihime*, two short stories involving characters from *Tsukihime* (後日談 and 幻視同盟), the first four chapters of [*Kara no Kyoukai*](kara-no-kyoukai-1-the-garden-of-sinners.html), and other goodies such as character data and wallpaper.

In April 2003, it was re-released along with *Tsukihime* and [*Kagetsu Tohya*](kagetsu-tohya.html) as [*Tsuki-Bako*](tsuki-bako.html). The re-released version came with two new stories compiled from NScripter to the more capable KiriKiri engine.
