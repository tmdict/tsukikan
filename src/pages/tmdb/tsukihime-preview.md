Released during the 1999 summer Comiket, where only 300 copies were distributed (for free, on 3.5 floppy disks). At the time the game was still in a very early stage of production planning. There were only three main heroines: Arcueid, Ciel, and Akiha. Hisui and Kohaku were only supporting characters, and was only added as main heroines later on. This version was later included in [*Tsukihime Plus-Disc*](tsukihime-plus-disc.html).
