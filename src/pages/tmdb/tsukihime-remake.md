A remake of the original [*Tsukihime*](tsukihime.html), with new artworks as well as a new Satsuki route.

Originally announced in April of 2008 in *Tech Gian* and [*Type-Moon Ace*](type-moon-ace-vol-1.html) together with [*Mahoutsukai no Yoru*](mahoutsukai-no-yoru.html) and [*Girls' Work*](girls-work.html) as part of the "The next worlds of TYPE-MOON" project. A few months after the announcement, a small website was put up for the game. Since the announcement, no new information has been released, and the website is no longer available after TYPE-MOON revamped its main homepage in mid-2010.
