Released as a special issue of the 2008 June issue of *Comptiq*, this magazine focuses exclusively on TYPE-MOON, and is treated as the official TYPE-MOON magazine that comes with new announcements, interviews, comics, and more.

After years of relative inactivity, the release of Volume 1 not only meant TYPE-MOON now has its own print outlet, but the amount of new information it offered was staggering. Aside from interviews, information, and a calendar, Volume 1 came with the big announcement of "The next worlds of TYPE-MOON" project, which includes the game [*Mahoutsukai no Yoru*](mahoutsukai-no-yoru.html), [*Girls' Work*](girls-work.html), and a [remake of *Tsukihime*](tsukihime-remake.html).
