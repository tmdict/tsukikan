The official magazine of TYPE-MOON, like [Volume 1](type-moon-ace-vol-1.html), this issue also came with a slew of new information, including the announcement that [*Mahoutsukai no Yoru*](mahoutsukai-no-yoru.html) would be released as three separate games, with the first one being released in 2009 fall (which later proved to be very much inaccurate, as the game keep getting delayed). There's also a spotlight on the seven [*Kara no Kyoukai* movie adaptations](kara-no-kyoukai-the-garden-of-sinners-chapter-1.html), [*Fate/Zero*](fate-zero-1.html) sound drama from Hobibox, and [*Fate/unlimited codes*](fate-unlimited-codes.html). Volume 2 also came with a [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html) side story titled [*Fate/strange fake*](fate-strange-fake.html).
