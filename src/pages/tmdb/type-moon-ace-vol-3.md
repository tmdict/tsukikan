The official magazine of TYPE-MOON. One of the biggest news in Volume 3 is the delay of [*Mahoutsukai no Yoru*](mahoutsukai-no-yoru.html), as well as information on the new [*Unlimited Blade Works* film](fate-stay-night-unlimited-blade-works-film.html). This volume also contained a funny body swapping manga involving characters from the TYPE-MOON universe, as well as a Drama CD titled [*Melty Blood -Rojiura Pyramid Night-*](melty-blood-drama-cd-rojiura-pyramid-night.html), which was adapted into a manga in early 2011.
