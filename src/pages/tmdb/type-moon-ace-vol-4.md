The official magazine of TYPE-MOON. Released in less than three months after [*TYPE-MOON Ace Vol. 3*](type-moon-ace-vol-3.html) came out, which was very short compared to the gap between [Vol. 2](type-moon-ace-vol-2.html) (6 months) and [Vol. 1](type-moon-ace-vol-1.html) (9 months).

This issue did not contain much new information, and offered mostly showcases of games, including [*Fate/EXTRA*](fate-extra.html), [*Mahoutsukai no Yoru*](mahoutsukai-no-yoru.html) (at the time still scheduled for a 2009 winter release), the [*Unlimited Blade Works* film](fate-stay-night-unlimited-blade-works-film.html), and some comics. Also included was an extra promotional DVD that contained the omake theatre *Ahnenerbe ni Youkozo! - Fate/wondering journey-*, a video hosted by TYPE-MOON's Mahoutsukai no Hako cast with Illya and Taiga explaining the [*Fate/stay night*](fate-stay-night.html) franchise up until that point.
