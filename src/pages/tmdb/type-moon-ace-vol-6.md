The official magazine of TYPE-MOON. This issue came with numerous big announcements related to TYPE-MOON projects for the year 2011, including the anime and [manga adaptation of *Fate/Zero*](fate-zero-volume-1.html), a Take Moon OVA titled *Carnival Phantasm*, as well as the news that [*Girls' Work*](girls-work.html) will be an anime (instead of a game, as announced in [Volume 1](type-moon-ace-vol-1.html)).
