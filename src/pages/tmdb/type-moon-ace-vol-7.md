The official magazine of TYPE-MOON. One of the most anticipated issues of *TYPE-MOON Ace*, the response to issue 7 was comparable to the release of issue 1. This issue came with a large amount of information on current and future TYPE-MOON works, including a [*Fate/Apocrypha*](fate-apocrypha-1.html) light novel, a new *LORD of VERMILION* game featuring characters from Mahoyo, and a (fairly final) release date of April 12, 2012 for [*Mahoutsukai no Yoru*](mahoutsukai-no-yoru.html). Last but not least, the issue came with a demo of *Mahoutsukai no Yoru*. The quality of the demo was so high that some fans immediately forgave TYPE-MOON for the game's delay.
