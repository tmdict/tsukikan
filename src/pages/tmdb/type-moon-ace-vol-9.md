The official magazine of TYPE-MOON. Celebrating *Fate* franchise's 10th anniversary, contents in this issue once again centers around *Fate*, and even unveiled a new "Sakura Saber." Many fans began to make fun of TYPE-MOON for coming up with yet another new Saber, as well as the fact that perhaps *TYPE-MOON Ace* should be renamed to *Fate Ace*. This issue included a card game called *Fate/Ace Royal*, a games that involves using Servant cards along with different Class cards, effect cards, and scene cards.
